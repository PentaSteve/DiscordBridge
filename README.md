# Discord Integration

## Setup

This is a server side only mod. Steps to set up:
1. install mod with fabric like you would with any other mod
2. run the server once. this will generate a config file in the configs folder for your server
3. edit the config file, add your discord bot token (you will need to make a discord bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   You will also need to add your server's unique name, this supports communication between an unlimited number of servers connected to the samer chat bridge channel.
   Also add the chat bridge channel id.
