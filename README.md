# Discord Integration

## Setup

This is a server side only mod. Steps to set up:
1. install mod with fabric like you would with any other mod
2. run the server once. this will generate a config file in the configs folder for your server
3. edit the config file, add your discord bot token (you will need to make a discord bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. enable multi-server mode if desired, this requires that all servers have a unique id in order for it to work correctly.
